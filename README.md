# Update ME!
Informs the player when your modpack needs an update

### How to use
 * Install [MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)
   * For Fabric this also requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and supports [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions)
 * Set `versionString` in config/updateme.json to the version name before realsing your modpack
 * Have a text file (maybe on github) that has the newest version name
 * Set `newestVersionURL` to the direct link to file
 * Any users playing a modpack version with a different version then the newest will get a popup whenever the launch the game, asking them to update the modpack
